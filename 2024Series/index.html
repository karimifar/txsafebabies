                  psychopathology, developmental psychobiology, developmental
                  neuroscience, and perinatal mental health to focus on the
                  earliest influences on children’s developmental
                  trajectories—those that happen in utero—and how to intervene
                  early to help pregnant people and prevent mental health
                  problems in the next generation. Her research has been
                  continuously funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH)
                  since her NIH Career Development award in 2000 as well as by

                  Texas Dell Medical School. She completed her psychiatry
                  residency and fellowship at the Medical University of South
                  Carolina (MUSC) where she then built her expertise in

                  She developed an early passion for removing barriers to care
                  for vulnerable populations and was especially drawn to serving
                  with persons requiring medications for opioid use disorder
                  (MOUD). Her clinical research and publications have been
                  impactful in this field. As director of the busy Women’s
                  Reproductive Behavioral Health at MUSC outpatient clinic, she
                  fostered key relationships with obstetric practices that
                  brought telehealth and MOUD to perinatal persons in rural
                  South Carolina. She has been a key individual in the formation
                  of South Carolina and Texas’ first perinatal psychiatry access
